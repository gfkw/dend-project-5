# Project 5 - Data Pipelines with Airflow

A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

## Apache Airflow

Airflow is a super feature rich engine compared to all other solutions. Not only we can use plugins to support all kinds of jobs, ranging from data processing jobs: Hive, Pig (though we can also submit them via shell command), to general flow management like triggering by existence of file/db entry/s3 content, or waiting for expected output from a web endpoint, but also it provides a nice UI that allows us to check our DAGs (workflow dependencies) through code/graph, and monitors the real time execution of jobs.

### Prerequisites


Tables must be created in Redshift before executing the DAG workflow. The create tables statements can be found in:

`create_tables.sql`

## Data Sources

Data resides in two directories that contain files in JSON format:

1. Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
2. Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data


## Data Quality Checks

In order to ensure the tables were properly loaded, a data quality checking is performed to count the total records each table has. If a table has no rows then the workflow will fail and throw an error message.

## Scripts Usage

* `create_tables.sql` - Contains the DDL for all tables used in this projecs
* `udac_example_dag.py` - The DAG configuration file to run in Airflow
* `stage_redshift.py` - Operator to read files from S3 and load into Redshift staging tables
* `load_fact.py` - Operator to load the fact table in Redshift
* `load_dimension.py` - Operator to read from staging tables and load the dimension tables in Redshift
* `data_quality.py` - Operator for data quality checking

## Built With

* [Python 3.6.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/) - Used to code DAG's and its dependecies
* [Apache Airflow 1.10.2](https://airflow.apache.org/) - Workflows platform
